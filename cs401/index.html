In this course, we will cover basic technique for the design and analysis of efficient computer algorithms for solving various kinds of problems. The prerequisites for this course include Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics. Hence,  you are <b>assumed to have already familiar</b> with basic data structures like <i>stacks, queues, tress, linked lists</i> etc., and basic concepts of discrete mathematics, such as basic <i>mathematical identities, series summations and recurrences</i>.

The following information on assignments and gradings are tentative and <b><i>subject to change</i></b> depending on the progress in the class. It is expected that there will be 3 assignments, 2 quizzes and 1 final examination.  <b>The final exam will be comprehensive</b>. Each assignment will involve solving some excercise problems and/or writing programs implementing some algorithm. Assignments <b>must be handed in class</b> on the date specified. <b><i>No late assignments will be accepted</i></b>. Discussions with other students about assigments is allowed, but the work handed in must be the student's own work.  <b>Tentative</b> weights of the assignments and exams in the final grading is as follows:

     of the Dean. <b>The MINIMUM penalty for any student found cheating will be to
