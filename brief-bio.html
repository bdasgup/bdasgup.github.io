Bhaskar DasGupta is currently an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at University of Illinois at Chicago. His specific research interests include designing and implementing efficient computational methods for computationally hard problems in application areas such as bioinformatics, systems biology and hybrid systems. Outside biology, his broader research interests in computer science include designing efficient algorithms for computationally hard problems in diverse areas such as computational geometry, parallel computing, optical networks and combinatorial auctions. DasGupta is a senior member of IEEE and has published about 100 research papers. His research works have been supported by numerous NSF grants, including an NSF CAREER award. DasGupta currently serves on the editorial boards of the journals IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, Advances in Bioinformatics, Theoretical Biology Insights, International Journal of Data Mining and Bioinformatics, International Journal of Information Sciences, and Computer Engineering and Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Applications.
