Curvatures of geometric shapes and topological spaces 
in higher dimension are natural and powerful 
generalizations of their simpler counter-parts, in
planes and other two-dimensional spaces, to higher 
dimensions and play a fundamental role in physics, 
mathematics and many other areas.  In this collaborative 
interdisciplinary proposal involving one investigator 
each from the University of Illinois at Chicago and 
the Pennsylvania State University, the investigators 
will use powerful higher-dimensional curvature analysis 
methods to provide the foundations of systematic and 
computationally efficient approaches to find critical 
components, measure redundancies and detect anomaly in 
biological and social networks. There is a pressing need 
for this, as identification of critical components are 
crucial to the analysis of networks, and curvature-based 
analysis methods provide a principled way of satisfying 
this need using a systematic and rigorous theoretical 
framework to achieve a clear understanding. The proposed 
research will leverage further development of novel 
combinatorial tools previously developed by the investigators, 
in addition to developing new algorithmic and approximability 
techniques. The algorithms developed in the course of this 
project will be implemented for validation on simulated and 
real data and will lead to open-source software for the 
relevant research communities. In addition to substantial 
impacts in network analysis, the proposed research will have 
strong impacts on many other research areas in computational 
biology, neuroscience and social network analysis. Other 
broader impacts will include integration of research and 
education via course and curriculum development, involvement 
of undergraduates, minorities and under-represented groups, 
effective dissemination of research, mentoring of undergraduate 
and graduate students, outreach and community involvement, and 
promoting diversity in related research and educational 
activities. The two investigators have a proven track record of 
extremely successful past collaboration via joint research 
publications and grants and are therefore confident that this 
grant will extend their past successful collaboration.

To achieve the goals of this project, the investigators will 
explore two notions of curvature, namely Gromov-hyperbolic 
curvature based on the properties of geodesics and higher-order 
connectivities, and geometric curvatures based on identifying 
networks with geometric complexes and using combinatorialization 
of Ricci type curvatures. These curvature measures depend on 
non-trivial global properties, such as distributions of geodesics 
and higher-order correlations among nodes, of the given network 
as opposed to many other measures that are local in nature. 
The investigators will use these notions to identify non-trivial 
critical components of the network whose removal affects the 
change the network topology or dynamics in a significant manner.
The investigators will formulate mathematically precise 
computational problems, study their properties, use novel 
algorithmic tools to design efficient algorithms, and implement 
the resulting algorithms to test their accuracy and efficiency. 
The complementary backgrounds of the two investigators, namely 
combinatorial optimization in computer science and computational
biology (DasGupta) and modelling and analysis of biological and 
social networks (Albert), will make the two investigators a 
perfect team for the interdisciplinary applications in this proposal.
