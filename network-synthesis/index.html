Our software performs combined synthesis, inference and
simplification of signal
transduction networks. The main idea of the application lies in
representing observed
indirect causal relationships as network paths, introducing
pseudo-vertices for unknown intermediaries of these paths and using
techniques from combinatorial optimization to find the most
parsimonious graph consistent with all experimental observations. The
software contains algorithms for (i) transitive reduction of an
initially synthesized graph subject to the constraints that no edges
corresponding to direct interactions are eliminated and (ii)
pseudo-vertex collapse subject to the constraints that real (known)
vertices are not eliminated.

It is well-known that biological and social interaction networks have a varying degree of redundancy,
though a consensus of the precise cause of this is so far lacking. In this paper, we introduce a topological 
redundancy measure for labeled directed networks that is formal,  
computationally efficient and applicable to a variety of directed
networks such as cellular signaling, metabolic and social interaction networks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of our measure 
by computing its value and statistical significance on a number of biological and social networks with up to 
several thousands of nodes and edges.
Our results suggest a number of interesting observations:
<ul>
<li>
social networks are more redundant that their biological counterparts, 

<li>
transcriptional networks are less redundant than signaling networks, 

<li>
the topological redundancy of the <i>C. elegans</i> metabolic network is largely due to its
inclusion of currency metabolites, and 

<li>
the redundancy of signaling networks is highly (negatively) correlated with the monotonicity 
of their dynamics.
</ul>

In this paper
we consider the p-ary transitive reduction (TR<sub>p</sub>) problem where
p>0 is an integer;
for p=2 this problem
arises in inferring a sparsest possible
(biological) signal transduction network
consistent with a set of experimental observations
with a goal to minimize false positive
inferences even if risking false negatives.
In this paper, our contributions are as follows:

<ul>
<li>
We observe that TR<sub>p</sub>, for any integer
p>0, can be solved in linear time
for directed acyclic graphs. 

<li>
We provide a 1.78-approximation
for TR<sub>1</sub> that improves the 2-approximation
known before.

<li>
We provide a 2+o(1)-approximation for TR<sub>p</sub> on general graphs
for any fixed prime p>1.

We introduce a new method of combined synthesis and inference of biological signal 
transduction networks. 
A main idea of our method lies in representing observed causal relationships as network paths and using 
techniques from combinatorial optimization to find the sparsest graph consistent with all experimental observations.
Our contributions are twofold:

<ul>
<li> 
we formalize our approach, study its computational complexity and prove <b>new</b> results 
for exact and approximate solutions of the computationally hard transitive reduction 
substep of the approach;  

<li>
we validate the biological 
usability of our approach by successfully 
applying it to a previously published signal transduction network by 
Li et al.  and show that our algorithm 
for the transitive reduction substep 
performs well 
on graphs with a structure similar to those observed in transcriptional 
regulatory and signal transduction networks.

We present a software for combined synthesis, inference and simplification of signal 
transduction networks. The main idea of our method lies in representing observed 
indirect causal relationships as network paths and using 
techniques from combinatorial optimization to find the sparsest graph consistent 
with all experimental observations.
We illustrate the biological usability of our software by
applying it to a previously published signal transduction network 
and by using it to synthesize and simplify a novel
network corresponding to activation induced cell death in large granular lymphocyte leukemia.
